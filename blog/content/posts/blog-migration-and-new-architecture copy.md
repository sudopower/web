Welcome to the new site! I decided to migrate my wordpress site from AWS Lightsail to Github Pages and use HUGO to build the site.

## Why the Switch?

As I learn more about software, the idea of less is more is becoming more and more appealing.
I don't really need a database, I don't really need a server, I don't really need a full fledged CMS.

## The New Architecture

This blog is now powered by [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go.

- I could style it it to look like a terminal, which I like.
- I want to be able to create code snippets.
    ```bash


    # Static Site Generator
    Hugo (Go-based template engine, fast HTML generation)

    # Hosting
    GitHub Pages (free, global CDN, easy to setup)

    # Deployment
    GitHub Actions (automated builds and deployments)

    # Content
    Markdown (simple, portable, easier version-control)

    # Styling
    Custom CSS (more control, easier to style)
    ```
- I can write posts in markdown, which is easy to write and edit.
- Github Pages is free.
- It's sort of a GitOps approach.

## What's Next?

I'll be migrating any valuable posts manually to the new site.
I think it will be a good excercise to revise some concepts and write about them.

## A Quote to End On

> "The best way to predict the future is to implement it." 
> â€” Alan Kay

This quote perfectly captures the spirit of this blog. 
Instead of just talking about technology, I believe in building, experimenting, and sharing the journey. 
Every post here will be grounded in real experience and practical knowledge, not AI slop.
